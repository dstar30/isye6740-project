    "The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the premier professional basketball association in the world. This sport has produced numerous stars and all time greats. There have been even more players that have excelled in their first, or rookie, NBA seasons. However, we have seen that a more accurate prediction of a playerâ€™s trajectory is from their second season."
